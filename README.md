As a developer building multiple Windows Services, the workflow can be a bit annoying. Launching the Services MMC snapin, finding the services, stopping them, starting them again, and so on. And sometimes you just need to delete a service. 



**ServiceBouncer** is a little tool that helps to streamline the workflow:

 - Filter Windows services so that you don't accidentally stop the wrong one.
 - Select multiple services and stop or start them
 - Delete services

Helpfully, the window witle tells you the status of the services, so you can quickly tell if your service is running without switching windows:
